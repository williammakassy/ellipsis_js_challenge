# ELLIPSIS_JS_CHALLENGE

This project was developed by William David Makassy.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start by downloading the project from the repository, the project name is *ellipsis_js__challenge*
2. Create new folder where you will remember the path of it, but I advice to create the folder to C drive
3. Then extract the downloaded project from github in the new folder which you have created.
4. After that open the text editor, for me I used the Visual Studio Code text editor which I'm comfortable with it.But You can use any text editor which supports JS.
5. If you use VS Code text editor click the File Tab and the select *Open Folder* where you have to choose the right path where you created the new folder.
6. By doing so all the files will appear on the right sidebar of the VS Code, After that click the shortcut `ctrl + j` to open the Terminal.
7. After opening the Terminal, you have to type the command `npm start` so to run the project to the browser.
8. Then after running the command the project will direct open to the browser where you can see all the list of series and movies fetched from the json file.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
